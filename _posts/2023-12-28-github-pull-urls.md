title: "Github Pull URLs: why make it hard?"
---

If I want to view the human-friendly HTML page for a pull request, I use this URL:
```
https://github.example.com/your-organization/your-repo/pull/12345
```
But if I want to view that same pull over the API, I have to use the plural `pulls`:
```
https://github.example.com/api/v3/repos/your-organization/your-repo/pulls/12345
```

Why make it hard?
