title: Can we all get on the same page with version/verbose flags?
---

Every. Goddamn. TIME. I try to figure out the version of a tool I'm using or try to run it with verbose output, I pick the wrong flag. Between `-v`, `-V`, `--version`, `--verbose`, and the god-forsaken `-version` (looking at you Java), it seems to be evenly split across all packages based on my totally statistically significant sampling. [GNU says](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html) that `--version` should ALWAYS output the current version, but we all know how much developers love standards.
