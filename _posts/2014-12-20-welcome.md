Welcome to my new blog. Yes, that is a '2014' you see in the date there, despite what my site looks like. This is a conscious choice as I dislike clutter, and also I am bad at web design.

So what can you expect to find here? Mostly short, ALLCAPS posts about stuff that pisses me off in the world of software. This is an inexhaustible list, clearly, but I'll try to yell about stuff that hasn't been done to death, <a href="http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">like</a> <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2002/papers/html/php/">PHP</a>.

I may make small tweaks to the design and organization of the site, but the totally bare, stripped-down, white-text-on-gray-background is likely to stay. Love it, or leave! Hopefully there will never be a byte of Javascript on this domain, otherwise I will have failed miserably.
